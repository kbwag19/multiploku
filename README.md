# Multiploku

This project contains a small multiplication game aimed at helping young learners practice multiplication tables.

## Setup

Install dependencies using the provided script:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

The script simply runs `npm install`. If you prefer, you can run `npm install` manually instead of using the script.

## Testing

After dependencies are installed you can run the test suite with:

```sh
npm test
```

The tests use Jest and jsdom to verify grid generation behaviour.
